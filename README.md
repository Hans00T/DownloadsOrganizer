# Downloads Organizer
## Description
This script organizes the downloads folder by moving files into folders based on their extension.
The script will create a folder for each extension and move the files into the corresponding folder. If a folder already exists for a certain extension, the files will be moved into that folder. The goal is to make it easier to find and manage files in the downloads folder. Sorting files by extension helps to find files faster and makes it easier to delete files that are no longer needed or move important files to another location.
## Requirements
- Python 3
- Any operating system
- Downloads folder in the home directory
## Usage
Open a terminal in the directory where the script is located and run the following command:
```bash
python organize_files.py
```
